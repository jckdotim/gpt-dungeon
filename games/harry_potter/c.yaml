  In the dungeon's depths, Harry encounters the ghost of the legendary wizard, who reveals a shocking truth.
  The dungeon was designed as a test by none other than Albus Dumbledore himself. Dumbledore created it as a
  challenge to train the most talented young wizards, preparing them for the unknown dangers they would
  face in their lives.

  The ghost explains that only a select few have ever managed to complete this trial, and Harry is now
  among them. This realization fills Harry with a renewed sense of purpose and pride, knowing that he has
  the potential to become one of the greatest wizards in history.

  The legendary wizard's ghost congratulates Harry and bestows upon him a unique gift: a magical tome
  containing powerful spells that have been lost for centuries. The knowledge within this
  book will help Harry unlock new abilities and protect his friends from the dark forces that threaten
  the wizarding world.

  As Harry leaves the dungeon, the ghost guides him to a hidden exit that leads directly to Dumbledore's
  office. Upon entering the room, he finds a letter addressed to him from Dumbledore, praising his
  courage and resourcefulness. The adventure may be over, but Harry knows that the lessons he learned
  and the friendships he forged in the dungeon will stay with him forever.
